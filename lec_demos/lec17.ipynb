So it's  best to store the Colab notebook in your personal drive `\"File > Save a copy in drive...\"` **before** you do anything else.\n","\n","The file will open in a new tab in your web browser, and it is automatically named something like: \"**Copy of lec17.ipynb**\". You can rename this to just the title of the assignment \"**lec17.ipynb**\". Make sure you do keep an informative name (like the name of the assignment) so that you know which files to submit back to WebCampus for grading! More instructions on this are at the end of the notebook.\n","\n","\n","**Where does the notebook get saved in Google Drive?**\n","\n","By default, the notebook will be copied to a folder called “Colab Notebooks” at the root (home directory) of your Google Drive. If you use this for other courses or personal code notebooks, I recommend creating a folder for this course and then moving the assignments AFTER you have completed them. <br>\n","\n","I also recommend you give the folder where you save your notebooks^ a different name than the folder we create below that will store the notebook resources you need each time you work through a course notebook. This includes any data files you will need, links to the images that appear in the notebook, and the files associated with the autograder for answer checking.<br>\n","You should select a name other than '**NS499-DataSci-course-materials**'. <br>\n","This folder gets overwritten with each assignment you work on in the course, so you should **NOT** store your notebooks in this folder that we use for course materials! <br><br>For example, you could create a folder called 'NS499-**notebooks**' or something along those lines.\n","___"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VJ-ZqsLVmadY"},"source":["# Import &
